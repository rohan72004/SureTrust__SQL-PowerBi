## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing tourism arrival and spending data to identify demand patterns, seasonality, growth markets, and future trends.  
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to support data-driven decision-making using KPIs, charts, slicers, and forecasting techniques.

## Dashboard Features

- Global overview of total visitors and total spend  
- Country-level drill-through analysis  
- Year-over-Year growth comparison  
- Seasonality index analysis  
- Arrivals vs Spend correlation  
- Six-month tourism demand forecasting  

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**
- **SQL**
- **Microsoft Excel**
- **Time-Series Forecasting**
- **Data Visualization & Analytics**

## Key Learnings

- Practical understanding of tourism data modeling  
- KPI creation and interactive dashboard design  
- Identifying seasonality and growth markets  
- Understanding that higher tourist volume does not always mean higher revenue  
- Improved documentation, analysis, and presentation skills
